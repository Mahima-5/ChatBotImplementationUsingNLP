# ChatBot Implementation Using NLP

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries intelligently. The chatbot recognizes different intents and provides relevant responses using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing and scikit-learn for training a simple machine learning model. Currently, the chatbot utilizes predefined responses, but an NLP-based model implementation is planned for future enhancements.

## Features
✅ NLP-based text processing using NLTK  
✅ Intent recognition to classify user input  
✅ Predefined responses for different intents  
✅ Machine Learning-based response prediction (upcoming)  
✅ Interactive console-based chatbot  
✅ Easily customizable intents and responses  

## Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍  
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**  
- **Scikit-learn (TF-IDF Vectorizer & Logistic Regression) - (To be implemented soon)**  
- **JSON for training data**  

## How It Works
1. **Data Preparation:** The chatbot is trained on a dataset containing various intents, patterns, and responses (stored in `intents.json`).
2. **Text Preprocessing:** The input text is tokenized and vectorized (NLP enhancements coming soon).
3. **Response Generation:** Based on the classified intent, the chatbot provides a predefined response.

## Usage
Run the chatbot:
```bash
python chatbot.py
```
Type a message, and the chatbot will respond based on the trained model.

## Customization
You can modify `intents.json` to add new intents, patterns, and responses to make the chatbot more interactive.

## Future Enhancements
🔹 **Implementation of ML-based response prediction** using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF  
🔹 Integrate with Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS)  
🔹 Deploy as a Web App using Flask or Streamlit  
🔹 Train with Deep Learning (RNN/LSTM) for better accuracy  
🔹 Add real-time API integration (e.g., Weather API, News API)
